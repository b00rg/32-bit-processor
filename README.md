# 32-bit-processor
Simulating a 32-bit processor using VHDL, implemented at a gate level. 

This repository contains:
1. The vhdl simulation code (as FILENAME.vhd)
2. The test bench code (as FILENAME_TB.VHD)
3. The test documentation, which specifies how the code was testbenched (FILENAME_DOC.pdf)
4. The schematic generated using Vivado (FILENAME_Schematic.pdf)
5. The simulation waveform testbench with labelled cases as coded in the test bench (FILENAME_TD01.png)
6. The propagation delay as per the simulation waveform testbench (FILENAME_TD02.png). 

The schematic of the final processor is as follows:
